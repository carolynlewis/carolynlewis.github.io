<h2>This is my first website using the basic HTML and CSS coding I learned from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>.</h2>

<p>My past coding experience includes making my own HTML websites in the late 1990s and early 2000s and editing existing CSS codes from templates on Blogger and WordPress.</p>

<p>Except for copying and pasting the basic HTML code, I will be typing out all of the codes using Notepad++ with an HTML viewer plugin.
